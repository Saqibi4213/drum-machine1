# Drum Machine

This is a drum machine application that allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking on the drum pads or pressing the corresponding keyboard keys.

## User Stories

1. **Outer Container**: I should be able to see an outer container with a corresponding `id="drum-machine"` that contains all other elements.
2. **Display Element**: Within `#drum-machine` I can see an element with a corresponding `id="display"`.
3. **Drum Pads**: Within `#drum-machine` I can see 9 clickable drum pad elements, each with a class name of `drum-pad`, a unique `id` that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: `Q`, `W`, `E`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Z`, `X`, `C`. The drum pads MUST be in this order.
4. **Audio Elements**: Within each `.drum-pad`, there should be an HTML5 `audio` element which has a `src` attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of `clip`, and an `id` corresponding to the inner text of its parent `.drum-pad` (e.g. `id="Q"`, `id="W"`, `id="E"` etc.).
5. **Click Triggering**: When I click on a `.drum-pad` element, the audio clip contained in its child `audio` element should be triggered.
6. **Keyboard Triggering**: When I press the trigger key associated with each `.drum-pad`, the audio clip contained in its child `audio` element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the `Q` key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string `Q`, pressing the `W` key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string `W`, etc.).
7. **Display Update**: When a `.drum-pad` is triggered, a string describing the associated audio clip is displayed as the inner text of the `#display` element (each string must be unique).
